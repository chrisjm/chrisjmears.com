I made a 4-minute video describing a method you can use to determine if and why a website is slow using Google Chrome, [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/), and a little [Inspector Magic](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/) ‚ú®.

Following the advice of Jon Acuff by way of the book [Finish: Give Yourself the Gift of Done (Amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/Finish-Give-Yourself-Gift-Done/dp/B074P95LWW/ref=tmm_aud_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=), I decided not to wait until I achieved perfection with video. It was difficult (so many mistakes! ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è), but I glad it's out there so I can focus on something else.

Enjoy the imperfections. üòÅ
