I'm very excited to announce that a book I've written has been published!  The book is called [TextMate How-to](http://www.packtpub.com/textmate-powerfully-versatile-text-and-code-editor/book) and is published by [Packt Publishing](http://www.packtpub.com/).

At just a little over 70 pages, it's a short read geared toward web developers and designers who want to learn about the best features of [TextMate 1.5](http://macromates.com/) without diving too deep into the manual.  It covers the following topics:


- Configuring TextMate, including installing themes
- Navigating text and files quickly and easily
- Converting text using the best and most useful methods
- Searching using various methods whether in one or multiple files
- Creating and utilizing projects
- Installing bundles quickly and easily
- Overview of some of the more useful bundles
- Utilizing shell commands and variables
- Recording and using macros to speed up your editing


This book is not meant to be a comprehensive source (see <a href="http://pragprog.com/book/textmate/textmate">TextMate: Power Editing for the Mac</a>), but I hope it'll be a go-to resource for those who wish to learn the best practices of TextMate quickly.
