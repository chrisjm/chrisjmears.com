Freelancers and solopreneurs need a toolkit they use daily to make their business and personal lives more manageable. Doing everything solely in spreadsheets and many Word documents can only get you so far.

The easy-win automation provided in existing services is beneficial if a solo business owner is going to have a maintainable work/life balance.

I've split these articles into four parts. The first part will cover "Project Management & Productivity." Next week, part 2 will continue with "Communication & Scheduling." Part 3 will dive into "Business & Finance." Finally, I'll wrap up with part 4, "Web Hosting."

Let's get starting with Project Management and Productivity tools which keep me sane and organized.

## Project Management and Productivity Toolkit

As a solo business owner, I try to keep things simple when it comes to my project management. Too many overwhelming features lead me too deep into the weeds.

These are the tools I use every day to get things done, keep existing clients informed, and onboard new customers.

### [Todoist](https://todoist.com)

I've been a Todoist user for most of my professional career. Since it syncs across devices and platforms, I use it as my primary task inbox (*side note: I use the built-in iOS Reminders for grocery and simple lists*).

I have Projects and sub-projects for granularity and so that I can archive a Project when it's not currently in use. My top-level projects are:

* Business (clients and business development),
* Projects (personal projects),
* Education (any courses I'm learning at the time), and
* Personal (self-care and dog reminders).

While it's not for everyone, Todoist's features are in-line with my workflow. Along with the Project organization and archiving, I also find the context tags useful for bundling similar tasks to plan days and reduce excessive context switching. For example, some days I want to hammer out all of my business-related tasks such as accounting and business development before (or instead of) diving into code.

**Purpose:** Todo list<br>
**Cost:** Free or $29/year for Premium

### [Trello](https://trello.com/)

I come from a software development background, so I find the action of moving cards horizontally from one list to another to be oddly satisfying (see the [HBO series "Silicon Valley"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oyVksFviJVE) or [read more about Kanban](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/boards)).

Trello tends to confuse people, and I understand why. I initially found it challenging to create new boards. However, once I saw the [Inspiration Boards](https://trello.com/inspiration), everything became more evident.

I have boards for my clients, yearly goals, code projects, study plans, etc. To reduce being overwhelmed, I ensure I'm only actively working on 6 or fewer boards at any given time by using the [Starred Boards feature](https://help.trello.com/article/965-starring-a-board).

One drawback is that my clients haven't all been receptive or use the Trello. So while it hasn't been a useful client communication tool (i.e., email is still king), I mainly use it for my sanity, organization, and knowledgebase.

**Purpose:** Project organization<br>
**Cost:** Free

### Google Docs

Google Docs has quite a bit of notoriety surrounding it, so I won't go into detail about this comprehensive suite of collaborative apps. But, in the interest of SEO, those apps include [Google Docs]( https://www.google.com/docs/about/), [Google Sheets](https://www.google.com/sheets/about/), [Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/), [Google Drawings](https://docs.google.com/drawings), and [Google Slides](https://www.google.com/slides/about/).

**Purpose:** Shareable documents<br>
**Cost:** Free (and a Google account)

### Honorable Mentions I Don't Currently Use (but might in the future)

While my current setup works best for me, future changes to my business may dictate I change ways. Since we must always be willing to adapt to our surroundings, these are a few other project management tools I've considered and am considering for the future.

### [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/)

Long-standing project management tool, but priced best for teams of two or more. That said, their customer support is incomparable. They love their customers, and it shows.

**Purpose:** Project management for teams (2+)<br>
**Pricing:** $99/month all-inclusive

### [Notion](https://www.notion.so/)

Notion provides an all-in-one collaboration tool. I tried it for a day but found it overwhelming. However, I've heard good things from users, and I understand the appeal. For now, I'll stick with moving my cards between lists ðŸ˜†.

**Purpose:** All-in-one collaborative workplace<br>
**Price:** Free up to $8/user/month.

### [Monday](https://monday.com/)

This project management tool has popped up on my radar recently.  It looks beautiful and user-friendly. However, it also seems most useful for and marketed towards medium-to-large teams of 5 or more.

**Purpose:** Project management<br>
**Pricing:** Basic plan is $25/month for up to 5 users. The price only goes up from there.


Next week I'll share what I use for Communication and Scheduling.

Thanks for reading!
