Have you ever needed a little extra boost of motivation to get some work done?

For instance, I could *not* convince myself to write this short article. "Only a minimum of 300 words," I tell myself. But, I keep checking my email. Training my dog. Cleaning dishes. Anything to avoid having to sit down and focus for 30 minutes. So, I grab my trusty pomodoro (Italian for "tomato") timer. Yep, I even have one shaped like a tomato for extra fun!

There are different variations of the Pomodoro technique, but this is the method I use:¬†

1. **Decide on a task to do.**
2. **Set a timer for 25 minutes.** More or less depending on you or the task.
3. **Concentrate on that one task for the entire time.** Shut down your email. Silence your phone. Put on headphones and play¬†your favorite concentration music. The goal is to minimize the disturbances¬†so that you can get into [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)).¬†
4. **Once the timer is complete, stop doing the task.** Seriously, pencils down!
5. **Take a short 5 minute break.**¬†Get up, walk around, [let your mind diffuse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJtUg-3DfUk) the short burst of deep work you just did. Check email if you must, but if you have more time left for the task, I find it's best to keep in the same frame of mind.
6. **Repeat!**

The [original Pomodoro technique method](https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique) suggests taking a long break (15-30 minutes) after a series of 4 short breaks (3-5 minutes).

Along with the traditional mechanical timer, there are web and software options available. However, I find the sound of the mechanical ticking adds to my level of concentration and flow. I admit that sometimes I jump when the timer rings.

*RRRRRIIIIINNNNNNGGGGG!!!!!*

Huh, look at that. I just finished writing the draft of this article.
