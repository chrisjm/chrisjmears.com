After spending way too long using a plain black and white color scheme in Terminal and being unimpressed with the theme options under Terminal > Preferences... Settings Tab, I decided to do a little bit of searching to remedy the situation.


I ran across Todd Werth's [IR_Black Terminal theme](http://blog.infinitered.com/entries/show/6), which seemed to be very easy on the eyes.  Actually, at the time of this writing, Todd Werth's theme is the _only_ theme I've found.
