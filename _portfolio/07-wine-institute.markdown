description: Wine Institute is the advocacy group for California wineries. The website required a major overhaul, which included a redesign and incorporating a CMS back-end so that it could be easily updated by the Communications and Legal departments. Working with Novahurst Creative, we were able to customize the Drupal CMS in order to achieve our goals.
